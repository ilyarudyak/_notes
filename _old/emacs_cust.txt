1) three ways to customize emacs: 1) custom 2) options menu - just a backdoor to custom 3) ~/.emacs file
  - in any case .emacs is modified; when using options to save options    for future use 'save options'

2) M-x custom and then just use mause to change smt (themes for example) 

3) .el seems to be a file extension for lisp; and .emacs.el and .emacs are the same file; packages for emacs have this .el extension

4) typical lisp command looks like (function arguments)

5) *main idea* - just use examples to config your file if you are not a seasoned lisp programmer

package management
---------------------

0) add package manager to .emacs ( ELPA (aka package.el) http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/ - one of the largest)
1) M-x list-packages
2) there is the status column in the list and there a few status types: available, installed, built-n etc.
3) packages are installed in ~/.emacs.d/elpa 

question: do we have add something to .emacs after installing a package? 

answer: it seems yes - nothing works without additional configuration.
