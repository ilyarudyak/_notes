2 main features: 
1) :desk.object_id # the same object_id in comparison with "desk"
2) immutable, no assignment

3) :desk.to_s # prints desk
4) no string methods
5) internally, Ruby uses symbols to keep track of all the names itâ€™s created for variables, methods, and constants; and stores them into its symbol table.

usually we use symbols based on 1) and 2). most common uses: a) hashes (required immutable key in a hash - search time O(n) for string and O(1) for a symbol) b) attr_getter etc. (not required). 

also there are some performance differences between using symbols and strings.
