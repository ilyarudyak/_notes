1) what are evaluated to true and false? ok 
2) load, require, include ok
3) how to open a class? ok 
4) default, optional and variable arguments - see /Users/IRudyak/mycodelink/well_ground/vararg.rb ok
5) dup, clone and freeze ok
6) 







1) Ruby has a simple definition of truth. Any value that is not nil or the constant false is true — "cat", 99, 0, and :a_song are all considered true. - see pickaxe, p. 132.

2) load, require, include - see lynda ruby

load: loads a source file every time it is called
require: loads a source file *only once*

include: includes modules, *nothing* to do with files  

3) classes are always open (see learning ruby, p. 126):

You can open the Array class and add a method to it such as array_of_ten, as shown in Example 9-2. This feature makes the language incredibly flexible.

Class Array
  def array_of_ten
    (1..10).to_a
  end
end

5) dup, clone and freeze

To complete the picture, there’s also a method called clone. It’s a lot like dup. The dif- ference is that if you clone a frozen object, the clone is also frozen—whereas if you dup a frozen object, the duplicate isn’t frozen.

Some dangers still lurk, though. Even if you freeze an array, it’s still possible to change the objects inside the array (assuming they’re not frozen). well-grounded, p. 57
