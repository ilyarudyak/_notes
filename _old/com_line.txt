history
--------------
Three ways to work with history: 1) fc 2) ! 3) ReadLine Library.

1) fc - main features: a)it's possible to edit a command before execution b) it's possible to list commands based on their number OR name 

  - fc -l # list 16 last commands
  - fc -l -10 # list 10 last commands; there are other commands with numbers
  - fc -l git # all commands starting from last git  

  - fc 527 # open vim to edit the 527 command; it will be executed when vim is closed

  - fc -s 527 # execute 527 command w/o openning vim; it's possible to use !527 instead
