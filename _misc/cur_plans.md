### September
- so what should we do in **September**?
- I guess I should switch gears and do some `vision` (otherwise I'd be stuck with `NLP`) but still in pytorch and also with `fastai`:
  - finish `cs230` (it's the 3d and the last attempt);
  - maybe listen for the `vision` part of the `udacity` course;
  - do 2 projects: (a) dog breeds from `udacity` (1); (b) something from `Kaggle` (2);
  - do a project for `cs230` (like we did for `cs224n`) (3);
  - do a project for a current `Kaggle` competition (4);
  - let's also do a project with `GANs` from `udacity` (5);
- that's a pretty ambitious program and I probably should move self-driving cars to the next year;

### October
- and what are our plans for **October**?
- finish `BERT`; part of `fast.ai` course on `NLP`;
- we need to do a couple or more projects on NLP: (1) MT from `udacity` (if it's in pytorch); (2) something from finished `Kaggle` competition; (3) something from current `Kaggle`;
- finally do that default project from `cs224n` (4);
- so basically this is **the end** of building my project portfolio;

### November
- we may do computational linear `algebra` course and `part 2` from `fast.ai`;

### Next Year
- when are we going to finish cs230?
- let's postpone `keras` and this course for the next year; also we'll have to read all the articles on basics;
- we may also do `NLP` courses from `fast.ai` and Stanford;
