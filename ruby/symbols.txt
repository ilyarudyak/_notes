1) :desk.to_s # prints desk
2) :desk.object_id # the same object_id in comparison with "desk"
3) immutable, no assignment
4) no string methods

usually we use symbols based on 3) and 4). most common uses: a) hashes (required immutable key in a hash - search time O(n) for string and O(1) for a symbol) b) attr_getter etc. (not required). 

also there are some performance differences between using symbols and strings.
