Remember That a Good Program...

  ... is decomposed logically into functions where any one function does one and only one task.

  ... has a main program that reads like an outline of what the program will do.

  ... has descriptive function, constant and variable names.

  ... uses constants to avoid any "magic" numbers in the program.

  ... has a friendly user interface.
