xml tags
----------

- <![CDATA[ ... ]. CDATA stands for (unparsed) Character Data, meaning that the CDATA content will not be interpreted by the XML processor. This is *opposed* to PCDATA, which stands for Parsed Character Data. 

Common uses for the CDATA section are to enclose HTML and JavaScript so that they are not parsed by the XML processor.

- predefined entities. There are many letters and symbols that can be inserted into HTML documents by using entities. In XML, however, there are only *five* predefined entities.
