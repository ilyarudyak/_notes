- startActivity() can be an implicit intent; for example we start google maps with startActivity();
- we have only 3 types of intents: startActivity(), startService() and sendBroadcast() (with some variations);
- there is no "share" intent; this is standard implicit intent with action ACTION_SEND;

how to build an intent:

  - component name/action;
  - data (URI and type) - do not confuse with extras;
  - category (?);
  - extras; Just as some actions use particular kinds of data URIs, some actions also use particular extras. For example, when creating an intent to send an email with ACTION_SEND, you can specify the "to" recipient with the EXTRA_EMAIL key, and specify the "subject" with the EXTRA_SUBJECT key.
  - flags;

pending intent:
----------------

- A PendingIntent object is a wrapper around an Intent object. The primary purpose of a PendingIntent is to grant permission to a foreign application to use the contained Intent as if it were executed from your app's own process.

- Major use cases for a pending intent include:

  a) Declare an intent to be executed when the user performs an action with your Notification (the Android system's NotificationManager executes the Intent).
  b) Declare an intent to be executed when the user performs an action with your App Widget (the Home screen app executes the Intent).
  c) Declare an intent to be executed at a specified time in the future (the Android system's AlarmManager executes the Intent). 

- use PendingIntent.getActivity() for an Intent that starts an Activity etc.
