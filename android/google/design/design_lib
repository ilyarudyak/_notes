what functionality do we have in this lib?

  - i'd say this is like Bootstrap for web: most of the work is done in xml;

  views:
    - navigation view (for navigation drawer);
    - floating labels;
    - FAB;
    - Snackbar;
    - Tabs;

  motion:  
    - CoordinatorLayout - introduced in this library and help us deal with motion:

      (a) It works with FAB: snackbars; new attributes - layout_anchor attribute and layout_anchorGravity;
      (b) It also works with app bars and toolsbars (collapsible and );

  (8) how to add tabs:

    - xml: add <...TabLayout> into <...AppBarLayout>;
    - java: find tabLayout by id and use newTab() and addTab() methods;

  (9) toolbar - exit screen with content:

    - xml: we have to wrap our content (buttons in our case) into NestedScrollView (ScrollView doesn't work with CoordinatorLayout);
    
    - xml: add flag to Toolbar

      app:layout_scrollFlags="scroll|enterAlways" 

  (10) just comment tabs;

  (11) toolbar - collapsable toolbar:

    - xml: use CollapsingToolbarLayout as a wrapper for toolbar inside AppBardLayout; change AppBarlayout height;

    - xml: remove flags from toolbar and set flags in CollapsingToolbarLayout

      app:layout_scrollFlags="scroll|exitUntilCollapsed"

    - xml: add new mode to toolbar

      app:layout_collapseMode="pin"
