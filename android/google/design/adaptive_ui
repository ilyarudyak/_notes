Patterns 
-----------

  (1) Reveal - elements such as a side nav may become visible (kind of two-pane layout).
  (2) Transform - side navigation may transform into tabs.
  (3) Divide - this is the new version of reveal, when we use a dialog to show detail screen.
  (4) Reflow - instead of 1 column of cards 3 or 4;
  (5) Expand - this is just margin;

  - it seems (2) is not mentioned in the class.
