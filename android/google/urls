why do we use both URI and URL?
  - well, HttpURLConnection accepts URL but URI has builder;

what fields does URL class have?
  - URL has variables for scheme, host, query etc.

how to build URL?

  parameters -> Uri.Builder -> Uri -> URL
  
  1) we use Uri.Builder (with given baseString): 

      Uri builtUri = Uri.parse(baseString).buildUpon()
            .appendQueryParameter(...)
            .build();
  2) we construct URL from string (we don't have constructor from Uri!):

    URL url = new URL(builtUri.toString());
