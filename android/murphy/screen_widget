how to create a screen widget?
  1) add a broadcast receiver to manifest with some specific features;
  2) add a layout (there are some restictions on what we can use here);
  3) create Broadcast Receiver; we use its subclass AppWidgetProvider and prinarily override onUpdate();
  4) in order to use onUpdate() we have to create those RemoteViews; the mechanism is slightly different from the one we usually use for creating views;
