how to get String from resource file?

  - context has method getString(int resId), so we call getString(R.string.some_string);
  - in other xml file we call it like @string/some_string;

how to get InputStream from raw resources and assets?

  - we get Resource object with getResources(); and use openRawResource(int id);
  - again we have context method getAssets() and then we use open(); but now we use name of the file in assets folder, not int id;

difference btw assets and res

  - One benefit of using assets over raw resources is the file:///android_asset/ Uri prefix. You can use this to load an asset into a WebView.
