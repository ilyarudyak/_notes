what is ContentResolver?
  - it seems we can not simply query ContentProvider, so we have to use this class;

how do we get info using ContentResolver?
  - we use methods like query() and async task; in case of SELECT * FROM we provide Uri and list of variables (so called projection);

what are other methods to get info from provider?
  - we may also use CursorLoader; it seems we use it in sunshine;

what are the major classes related to db (in android)?

  - SQLiteDatabase: the database itself;
  - SQLiteCursor: the cursor that we get from query;
  - SQLiteQueryBuilder: to build and execute queries;
  - SQLiteStatement: ???
  - SQLiteOpenhelper: we create db using this clss
