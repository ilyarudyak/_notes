how is palette organized?

  - Palette is a set of Swatch objects: vibrant and muted and their tints (оттенки); basically Swatch is an object for color;

  - we can get a swatch like this: palette.getVibrantSwatch();

  - then we extract colors from Swatch object like this: swatch.getRgb();

what Swatch objects are available?

  - 6 predefined color profiles, they are specified here: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/graphics/Palette.html;

  - we can define number of swatches (?) with maximumColorCount(int numOfSwatches); default number - 16;

  - vibrant and dark vibrant are the most commonly used;

how to generate Palette object?

  - This can be done using the Palette.Builder either synchronously by calling the generate() method without any parameters, or asynchronously by calling generate(Palette.PaletteAsyncListener listener). 

  - Because it can take time to create the Palette, it is recommended that the synchronous method only be called from a background thread.

what does a Swatch object contain?

  - color for background and text(?); also population value reflecting the number of pixels represented by the Swatch;
