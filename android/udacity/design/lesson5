how to determine layout?

  - we may do that by querying if a given view exists and is visible:

    View articleView = findViewById(R.id.article);
    mIsDualPane = articleView != null && 
                  articleView.getVisibility() == View.VISIBLE;

  - another example of how you can adapt to the existence of different components is to check whether they are available before performing an operation on them:

    if (catButton != null) {
      catButton.setOnClickListener(listener);
    }

how to react on different layout?

  - we may use mIsDualPane or other similar variable in our java code;

how to define boolean (integer) res?

  - see here: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/more-resources.html; and here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16113608/a-boolean-value-defined-in-xml-how-to-reference-in-java

  - we may use bools.xml, but filename is arbitrary; we can include it in other file, say dimens.xml;

    <bool name="enableQAurl">true</bool>

  - in java we call it like this:

    Resources res = getResources();
    boolean enableQAurl = res.getBoolean(R.bool.enableQAurl);

  - we use the same approach with integers (see the same link); we may change LayoutManager and item layout based on number of columns;

how to use integers in xml?

  - we may use smt like this:

    <GridView 
      ...
      android:numColumns="@integer/grid_columns" 
      ...
