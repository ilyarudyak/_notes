how to create 2-pain layout?

  - xml:

    1) create layout-sw600dp folder: we create 2-pain layout for nexus 7 (960dp x 600dp); both for portrait and landscape;  
    
    2) create activity_main.xml in this folder: we override normal file; we add frame layout for the second fragment (dynamic fragment); 
    
    for forecast we use static fragment as in phone layout; we use this xml file for both portrait and landscape on a tablet;

    detail fragment should be dynamic in phone layout as well (?);
    

  - java (changes in main activity):

    4) we check if we have a tablet:

      findViewById(R.id.weather_detail_container) != null

    and add dynamically detail fragment in this container;

    5) we also set mTwoPane = true (we use this in callback to replace our fragment);

    6) we also use fragments tags and update fragments on location change somehow;
