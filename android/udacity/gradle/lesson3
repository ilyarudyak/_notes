intro 
------

- Android Studio doesn't[br]even use an internal builder. Android Studio delegates its entire build process to Gradle.

- Gradle itself doesn't inherently[br]know anything about Android. That capability's provided by Google in[br]the form of an Android Gradle plugin.

- Android Studio is actually happy to[br]import and work with any Gradle project.

- It maintains its own internal[br]model of your project, and when a project is loaded or[br]a Gradle build script changes, Android Studio needs to synchronize its[br]internal model with Gradle's model.

android plugin
----------------

- we'll be covering six main themes: 

  1) The first is *build variants*. It's often useful to build slightly[br]different versions of the same app, such as debug version for[br]testing and a release version for the Google Play store. Another common use case is a free[br]version and a paid version of your app.

  2) Android plugin allows us to manage *dependencies* on a per variant basis.

  3) Android plugin can override resources and *manifest* entries also[br]on a per variant basis.
