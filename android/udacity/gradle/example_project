- we use predetermined structure of a project: source code in the directory src/main/java etc.;

- we use java plugin: apply plugin: 'java';

- we build a project with: gradle build; this actually contains a lot of tasks (compile, assemble, jar etc.);

- UP-TO-DATE - we use incremental build (automatically identifies that no work needed to be done);

- custom build: 1) we add version to *.jar; 2) add main class to manifest; 3) deal with legacy projects - specify that code is in src, not src/main/java;

- dependencies: instead of manually download and include libs we can add a) repository (like mavenCentral()) and b) dependencies; gradle download and include all libs automatically;
