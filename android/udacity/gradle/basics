- The default naming convention for a Gradle build script is build.gradle. When executing the command gradle in a shell, Gra- dle looks for a file with that exact name.

- doLast(): An action named doLast is almost self-expressive. It’s the last action that’s executed for a task. Gradle allows for specifying the same logic in a more concise way. The left shift operator << is a shortcut for the action doLast.

- One of Gradle’s productivity tools is the ability to abbreviate camel-cased task names on the command line. If you wanted to run the previous example in the abbreviated form, you’d just have to type gradle yG0 gT.
