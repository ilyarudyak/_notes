introduction
--------------

what is its full name?
  - com.android.application;

where to get documentation?
  - on DAC site (including API and link to a detailed guide), 
  no description in Gradle guide;

why do we have two gradle.build files?
  - one relates to the project and one to a module;

ok, what is the difference between project and module?
  - well, it seems a project can include: a) Android and/or 
  Java library modules; b) App engine modules; c) Android 
  application modules for different devices (watch, TV etc.);

configuration
---------------

what are the main configuration options?

  1) build variants:                android/buildTypes
      debug/release, paid/free;
  2) dependencies:                  dependencies
      module, local and remote;
  3) manifest entries;              android/defaultConfig                      
  4) signing;
  5) proguard;                      android/buildTypes/release
  6) testing;

why do we need to override manifest entries?

what are necessary config options?
  - only two: compileSdkVersion and buildToolsVersion;

what are the standard build script (high level)?

  android {
      compileSdkVersion 22
      buildToolsVersion "23.0.0 rc2"

      defaultConfig { ... }
      buildTypes { ... }
  }

  repositories { mavenCentral() }
  dependencies { ... }
