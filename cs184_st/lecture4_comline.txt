1) new insight - use unix tools in your daily life; they very powerful and robust; sobell is a right book; but there are others; 

    - no way to finish learn unix in two weeks;

cp, mv etc.
---------------

2) the main option cp and mv have -i: ask for permission when overwrite a file (both of them work in a unix way cp file1 file2); they ask only when there is a problem (in contrast with rm; he even recommend making an alias cp='cp -i';

**difference between cp amd mv**
cp has -r option but mv has not; so mv just moves directories but cp does not without this option;

** diff between cp, mv and rm**
a) when we use -i option rm always ask but cp,mv only when they overwrite a file
b) rm has -f option but others do not

3) mkdir -p dir1/dir11 when dir 1 does not exist

links
----------------

4) we can update link to point it to another file: ln -sf data2.txt latest.txt

key combinations
------------------

5) useful key combinations on prompt (Alt set as Meta in preferences):

    Alt + F: Move cursor forward one word on the current line
    Alt + B: Move cursor backward one word on the current line 

    Ctrl + A: Go to the beginning of the current line 
    Ctrl + E: Go to the end of the current line

basic text
-------------

6) when using cat "-" is the stdin; example: ls | cat file1 - prints file1 and than ls command.

7) cat is an industrial strength editor - use it, not ms word; new insigth;

7a) head - prints first 10 lines; head -n 50 - first 50

7b) nl - numbering lines 9but with tab?); another approah to count lines (nl file | tail -1)


intermediate text
---------------------

8) grep

    - to find a word in a file: grep word file (example: grep protein *ptt | wc -l)    
    - it seems uniq works only on sorted output
    - to find a file contains a word: grep -l word file1 ...
    - to print 5 lines before or after match: grep -A 5 -B 5 pattern file9) sed

    - to change pattern1 to pattern2 in a file: grep 's/p1/p2/' (to do it globally '.../g'; actually change file -i)
    - to change file in place: -i (some problems on mac) 

wget
----------

10) it's very powerful tool - he gives an example how to recursively download an entire site;
